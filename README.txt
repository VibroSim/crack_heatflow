crack_heatflow
--------------

This package is used to predict heatflows due to crack surface rubbing
as an alternative to performing the calculation in COMSOL. It supports
two different calculation methods:
  1. Finite difference simulation (via the heatsim2 package)
  2. Greens function integration (internal; requires pyopencl)
